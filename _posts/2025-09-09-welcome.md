Welcome to my corner of the internet. I plan to write about:

1. **Sports analytics** — e.g., visualizing Statcast, streak models, run expectancy.
2. **Math notes** — probability, linear algebra refreshers, and fun problem breakdowns.
3. **Code** — from data cleaning tricks to small utilities and dashboards.

A quick math demo:
$$
\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}2.
$$

And a Python snippet for good measure:

```python
from statistics import mean

def batting_average(hits, at_bats):
    return round(hits / at_bats, 3)

print(batting_average(150, 500))  # .300
```
